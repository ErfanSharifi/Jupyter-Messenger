# Jupyter-Messenger

                                      *********** THIS CODE IS BEING UPDATED **************




it is about the messenger application with python and designing with Tkinter.
i will be happy if you share your ideas with me for develope this application.
for run this code you needed to instal tkinter library with this command:
pip install thinter
or 
search in goolge for "install tkinter on <mac OS,Linux,Windows>.
Tkinter has problem with Mac-OS and do not work correctly.
i run my code on Kali linux.
 and then you need database,i use sqlite.you can import with this command:
 
 import sqlite3
 
 if you don't have this module you can install with:
 
 pip install sqlite3
 
 so you can run cede.
